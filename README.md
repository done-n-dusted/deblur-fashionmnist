# deblur-fashionmnist
De-noise a blurred given image using Deep Learning methods of Machine Learning like Convolutional Neural Networks.

The motivation behind creating this program is to learn the use of auto-encoders. The program is loosely based on guided project from Coursera(https://www.coursera.org/projects/autoencoders-image-denoising) taught by Ryan Ahmed.

Steps Involved

    1. Load the data set
    2. Take the training set and blur the images.
    3. Create a CNN model.
    4. Train the model using the blurred images as an input and the original images as the ground truth.
    5. Test the model.
